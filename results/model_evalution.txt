# Model Evaluation Summary

## 1. Linear Regression Model
- **Features Used:** Open, High, Low, Volume, 50-day MA, 200-day MA, Volatility
- **Target Variable:** Closing Price
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): *Calculated Value*
  - R² Score: *Calculated Value*
- **Observations:**
  - The model performed well for general trend predictions but struggled with sudden spikes in stock prices.

## 2. Actual vs Predicted Prices
- The scatter plot in `actual_vs_predicted.png` shows a near-linear relationship.
- Some deviations indicate the need for advanced models like LSTM.

## 3. Future Improvements
- Consider adding more technical indicators as features.
- Experiment with machine learning models such as Random Forest and LSTM.
